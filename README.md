# Alumni-Connect-Website-Project
Alumini Connect is a website for connecting all of our Ex Alumni college students. It is a platform where all alumni can interact both publicly and privately through an inbuilt community chat . 

I made this project with my friend in Hackathon Competion from 2 April to 8 April 2023.
This Website is not responsive and only developed for Destop or PC view , i will make it responsive after short time .
