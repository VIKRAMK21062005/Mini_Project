        <p class="Para">  This friendship story began in the summer of 1973. We were among the fortunate young adults, from very different family backgrounds and cultures, accepted into engineering or pharmacy programs at BIT. Although we were excited to begin our new journey the first few weeks were not easy due to the fear of ‘ragging’ and cultural diversity we all brought to the campus. All new comers were housed in the outer most hostels and we had to walk to the main building for classes. We moved around the campus in groups to avoid being caught by a senior alone and to get to know our fellow students. Our circle of friends started growing by the day and simultaneously some close ties started to emerge based on our room locations, academic interests and extracurricular activities. Although I was fortunate to have many friends who were helpful in broadening my horizon in academics as well as in sports this post is for my two batch mates who will remain my close friends until their last day on this planet.

            Nimay Chandra Ghose (NC) was in the engineering program and Surendra Kumar Sharma (SK) was in my class of pharmaceutical sciences. Our family backgrounds and upbringing were very different. I came from a farmer’s family near Bhagalpur (Bihar) and went to Hindi medium public schools. My village elementary, primary and middle schools did not have benches for students and I had to bring a small mat to sit on the floor. Only the teacher had a simple stool or chair, and he taught almost all subjects. These schools mostly had no door and when there was one it was never locked (there was nothing to be taken from). NC came from a respectable doctor’s family in Banka (Bihar) and went through much higher standards of schooling and was reading English new papers from his early childhood. SK came from a successful business family in Delhi and was schooled in a reputed English medium Dehradun school. No wonder NC was so good in literature and SK preferred to speak in English, whereas I preferred Hindi. It is obvious that we three were from different worlds, but housed in adjacent rooms in the same hostel. Our friendship bonds became stronger and stronger with time we spent together at the campus. We had almost all meals, sports activities and outings together. One summer NC and I dared an adventurous motorcycle ride from Ranchi to Bhagalpur and back. One fall we travelled to Delhi and SK’s family took us as family members. One summer NC and SK came to my village and enjoyed the real country living.
            <br><br>
             The academic session was a yearly one and we wre taught a fixed number of courses. The Institute was under Bihar University and later it came into Ranchi University. Annual Exam used to take place and results anniunced in News Papers. First Division with Distinction, First Division and Second Division were given. The faculty who taught us were really devoted and took teaching very seriously. Most of the Engineering teachers were only having Bachelors degree and very few with msters degree. 
             One or two had Ph.D. in Engineering. In science subjects facutly had Ph.D. degree.The laboratory facilities and workshop was adequate for good training. Overall the teaching was very good. The Institute had good sports infrastructure and we could play football, volleyball, cricket, Tennis, Badminton etc. There used to be annual day program spread over fwe days and evenings were full music, skits, drama , etc. .For enertainment students club used to show movie every week end although on a small projector 16mm. 
             Otherwise students used to go to Ranchi Town to see a movie. The going to Ranchi town was not easy as Institue Bus used to play on fixed time only. There were no placement cell those days. Students had to manage their own employment after graduation. But some state Governents were sent the names of successful students and they received direct employment in Government departments.
             
             The institute had a small clinic where a Doctor used to be available in morning anf evening.Some basic medicines used to be abvilable.
             
             Fromour batch many went abroad for higher studies and some went for work too. 
             
             <br><br> Overall it had been a good experience of our student days. We had our Golden Jubilee in 2013 and now looking forward to have Diamond Jubilee in 2023.
